# Project Proposal

# Project title: Synthesize

# What and why?
Synthesize allows users to discover new music by curating custom playlists based on their existing music taste. It will allow the user to input a selection of songs or genres of their liking, which Synthesize will utilize in order to create a playlist of recommended songs. It can also be used in group mode, where each group member individually completes the quiz. Synthesize then combines each group member's preferred music into one large playlist that can be shared between the group. 

# For whom?
Synthesize is aimed at anyone who finds themselves repeatedly listening to the same music and wants to discover new music based on songs they currently enjoy. In addition, group mode can be helpful for family and friends who would like to create a custom playlist for a party, road trip, etc. while incorporating everyone's preferred styles of music. 

# How?
In individual mode, Synthesize will allow the user to input up to 5 songs or genres that best capture their music taste. The app will then recommend songs that are within the user's existing music taste, but that are unfamiliar enough to allow the user to discover music they have not previously been exposed to. Group mode will function identically, except that one link will be generated to the quiz, which can be shared amongst all members of the group. Each member completes the quiz individually, and when all group members are finished, Synthesize will merge each member's recommendations into one playlist. 

# Scope
This project could be suitable for 4-6 programmers throughout the semester. It will require the implementation of the quiz itself along with an algorithm that searches a library of music and finds songs that are similar in style to the user's input. If time permits, other features could be added, such as the ability to share a link to the created playlist on social media.
